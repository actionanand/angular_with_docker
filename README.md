# Angular with Docker

Creating angular 17 project without installing anything in host machine with the help of docker.

## Creating new project

```shell
docker-compose run --rm ng new --directory ./ --skip-install
```

* Give your desired name for the project when prompted
* Abort (CTR + C) if node package is getting installed

* If `node_modules` folder was created, the error like the below screenshot will be thrown when trying to run `ng serve`. So delete it, if it got created.

* Command to delete node_modules in Linux and wsl

```bash
rm -rf angular/node_modules
```

* Command to delete node_modules in powershell

```powershell
Remove-Item angular/node_modules -Recurse -Force
```

* Command to delete node_modules in command prompt

```cmd
rmdir angular\node_modules
```

### Modifying package.json file

* Add `"ng-start": "ng serve --host 0.0.0.0",` to `script` property in `package.json` file

### Running dev server

1. Spin-up the `vite` server

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build server
```

`-d` to run in detached mode.

2. Copy the `package-lock.json` to host machine

    * Check running conatiner by `docker ps` and consider this last container name is `angular_with_docker_server_1`

```bash
docker cp angular_with_docker_server_1:/app/package-lock.json angular
```

3. Point your browser to `http://localhost:4201/`

4. After finished working,

```bash
docker-compose down
```

to remove named volumes while removing container,

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Generating new component, service, etc using 'ng' command

```bash
docker-compose run --rm ng g c pages/home
```
```

### Installing with 'ng add'

* we can see example with `ng add @angular/pwa`. Other packages also uses the same way to be added!

```bash
docker-compose run --rm ng add @angular/pwa
```

### Installing some third party npm packages

1. Run `npm install` as below always

```bash
docker-compose run --rm npm install
```

2. Installing `lodash` follows below:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm npm install --save lodash
```

```bash
docker-compose run --rm npm install --save-dev @types/lodash
```

Remove `node_modules` after finishing it all.

### Testing Angular app

```bash
docker-compose up --build test
```

* Point your browser to `http://localhost:4203/`

* Remove the container

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Running Angular app in SSR mode

1. Building angular files

```bash
docker-compose run --rm build run build
```

2. Running express server

```bash
docker-compose run --rm build run serve:ssr:my_angular_play
```

* You can try any `script` in `package.json` after `npm` with `docker-compose run --rm build run`

## Preparing to push to docker hub

* Navigate to the folder where `angular.dockerfile` exists, then execute the below command

1. Building the image for Angular 17

```bash
docker build . -t actionanand/ng-create:17 -f angular.dockerfile
```

2. Pushing the Image

```shell
docker push actionanand/ng-create:17
```

## Utilizing docker hub Image

* Pull Angular 17

```bash
docker pull actionanand/ng-create:17
```

* Creating new angular project

```shell
docker run --rm -it --name ng-create -v "folder_path:/app" actionanand/ng-create:17 new
```

In mac, linux or wsl2

```shell
docker run --rm -it --name ng-create -v $(pwd):/app actionanand/ng-create:17 new 
```

In windows,

```bash
docker run --rm -it --name ng-create -v "D:\AR_extra\rnd\docker\test:/app" actionanand/ng-create:17 new
```

* creating new Angular project in the current folder

```bash
docker run --rm -it --name ng-create -v $(pwd):/app actionanand/ng-create:17 new --directory .
```
